        <i>The second part in this series of childhood games is now up: <a href="http://ninasays.so/myhousemyrules.html" target="0">My House My Rules</a></i>.

<p>Made @ Fishing Game Jam - <a href="http://emmettbutler.com" target="0">Emmett Butler</a>, Nina Freeman, audio by Deckman Coss</p>

<p>The inspiration for this game comes from a fishing trip I went on with my dad when I was a little girl. He caught a sunfish and thought it would be funny to swing it around on the line. At the end of his swing the sunfish smacked me right on the cheek.</p>

<p>This game was made using Flixel, Adobe Photoshop and GIMP. You can view the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/emmett9001/fist-of-the-north-carp">Github repository</a> and our <a target="_blank" href="http://jam.legendaryfisher.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=123">Fishing Jam Forum post</a>.</p>
