    My House My Rules is a game about a little girl and her snack stash. Her moms don't allow snacks, so she has sneak around the house and save them for later. Don't get caught! The idea for this game comes from Nina's own youth. Her mom was very strict about snacking, and would swoop in any time she heard even a squeak from the kitchen.
