<p>
so far today</p>

<p>two people have said:</p>

<p>a computer could easily replace you</p>

<p>cool thanks</p>

<p>if a computer writes better poetry than me <br />
so be it</p>

<p></p>

<p>(the truth is that computers are the most honest things in the world</p>

<p>but you don't have to agree with me <br />
you don't even have to read this poem)</p>

<p>...<br />
people watching is essentially lurking internet forums in real life</p>

<p>relax in a cab<br />
and watch the midtown clubs defiled by pop culture pass by from the window seat </p>

<p>never have i ever known how to<br />
be a functional member of society</p>

<p>my mom always told me 'keep to yourself,'<br />
'just nuke a potato' she would say</p>

<p>i darkened my own freckles anyways</p>

<p>that was the biggest risk i took today</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
my life is an emergency and so is yours<br />
 which leads me to believe that i should legally change my name to something threatening like DRAGONSLUT<br />
 &#968;(&#65344;w&acute;)&#968;</p>

<p>or dakimakura</p>

<p>dakimakura dakimakura</p>

<p>dig a ditch and throw me in with all the dakimakura</p>

<p>KAWAII HAS PERISHED press space bar to continue<br />
THE PARTY IS OVER press space bar to continue<br />
SERIOUSLY GET OUT press space bar to continue</p>

<p>/////////////<br />
heaven is a place on habbo hotel but not on earth<br />
heaven is definitely not on the bus<br />
it's not in philly and it's not in the matrix<br />
i'd rather go to the matrix than heaven anyways<br />

<p>
a person passes through history on a google search for truth</p>

<p>meanwhile i walk around soho <br />
which is always like super models-- <br />
cut to me oblivious<br />
in a sailor moon crop top</p>

<p>very different from being 12 at contempo <br />
with mom in black heels, tall and gorgeous <br />
emerging from a jungle of dress racks<br />
with the last pair of size 0 acid wash jeans</p>

<p>rouge red lips and eyelashes for miles<br />
fight evil and dress chic<br />
moms are forever for better or worse</p>

<p>her annual gift was barbie <br />
or many barbies</p>

<p>and one time i was playing sex with ken<br />
until by accident i ripped ken's leg off<br />
which kind of killed the mood</p>

<p>i was in aol cybersex chat rooms before i knew what sex was</p>

<p>now i know even less about it<br />
my bedroom is an anime bachelor pad<br />
and here i am drinking a cocktail called<br />
'the corpse reviver #2'</p>

<p>i hereby apologize to anyone and everyone i have ever kissed</p>

<p>namaste</p>

<p></p>

<p>
(' ')</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
please hold while i randomly read yahoo answers<br />
in search of enlightenment</p>

<p>what could be more zen than the internet?</p>

<p>i don't know, but my dad did call to ask when my birthday is<br />
 <br />
 today, i said<br />
 and he said,<br />
 oh right</p>

<p>yup dad, just like the last 22 years</p>

<p></p>

<p>...</p>

<p></p>

<p>sometimes i wish i was a geocities page<br />
unconscious and safe<br />
on a california harddrive</p>

<p>is there a plastic surgery for that?</p>

<p></p>

<p>*sigh*</p>

<p></p>

<p>i am just trying to be normal<br />
and according to cosmo that requires<br />
chunky as heck mascara</p>

<p>they say:<br />
trip and fall into his chest<br />
 say, DAMN your pecs are harder<br />
 than a solid brick wall<br />
 and then, finally,<br />
 'remember to breathe' when Making Out. <br />
 <br />
 Wow I Never Knew That</p>

<p>
dear cosmo,<br />
 <br />
please hire me for your shitty copywriter position</p>

<p>peace&amp;love</p>

<p>nina</p>

<p></p>

<p>~</p>

<p></p>

<p>my resume is a list of <br />
every video game i've ever beaten and<br />
anime i've watched<br />
and my pokemon card collection--<br />
so who wants to hire me</p>

<p>i'm a very well-rounded person <br />
circular-- globe-like, even <br />
I am a perfectly round geometrical object <br />
in three-dimensional space</p>

<p>but according to my mom i'm <br />
'goth'<br />
because i like lisa frank<br />
paint my nails black<br />
and eat vegan food</p>

<p>her first reaction to my tattoo<br />
'are you a liberal'</p>

<p>yahoo answers will my mom ever understand me<br />
???</p>

<p>she called me recently to ask<br />
 nina<br />
 how do you stalk people on the internet?</p>

<p>i guess i probably do seem like someone that<br />
would be good at stalking people on the internet</p>

<p>i'm wearing crop tops mom are you proud<br />
 i hope so because<br />
 i found them in your closet</p>

<p>thank god my mom worries about me</p>

<p>because<br />
the sky is just our world blue screening</p>

<p>and i don't know where else to go<br />
other than cyberspace</p>

<p>(...turns out<br />
instagram of my soul is just a black square anyways<br />
no filter)</p>

<p>good night moon<br />
good night sailor moon<br />
good night cat, ps3, special edition wii<br />
good night grip on reality</p>

<p>good night kawaii moon and other kawaii shit</p>

<p>star light, star bright<br />
i'm so fucking tired good night</p>

<p>()</p>

<p>my life is<br />
a suburban legend written in<br />
terminal on May 20th<br />
while everyone looks up<br />
in unison<br />
at the eclipse hovering<br />
over new york</p>

<p>it's a quiet road at night:<br />
summer solstice and<br />
amphibians crossing<br />
the street <br />
ecstatic in<br />
muddy ponds--<br />
they are safe from the <br />
headlights that<br />
seldom pass, unlike my<br />
bedroom in brooklyn where<br />
the lights are<br />
always passing</p>

<p>my life is an<br />
excuse to tear clouds down<br />
and arrange them into poems<br />
formless enough for words</p>

<p>in what programming language<br />
do i speak to speak with you</p>

<p>i'm scared that i can't understand </p>

<p>communication hurts my eyes<br />
because i'm always looking down<br />
at my phone</p>

<p>it's easier to do with background music<br />
filling in the conversation<br />
like madlibs</p>

<p>sit across the table from me<br />
and we can just text</p>

<p>you asked<br />
what is html for kissing<br />
and i said<br />
i dunno<br />
just follow your kokoro</p>

<p>i wanna watch youtube videos with<br />
you until we fall asleep<br />
snug as a spreadsheet</p>

<p>i can see the ocean over your shoulder<br />
and the waves scrolling by</p>

<p>i'm not actually using you for your dragonball z dvds</p>

<p>the feelings written here are hard to see<br />
if you're running windows 95</p>

<p>try linux instead</p>

ok this week is going to suck<br />
it's already raining, my<br />
free donut receipt is ruined</p>

<p>and some bro on yahoo answers <br />
is saying that black holes lead to nothing<br />
when i know <br />
for a FACT <br />
that they lead to anime</p>

<p>ehow do i rip a hole in space time<br />
because the world is too small<br />
and i want to set it free</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
 mapquest search<br />
 where is a nice seascape<br />
 to escape<br />
 my looming inbox</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>pretty girls are online in panties and <br />
slipping in piles of font effects</p>

<p>the pretty girl's so addicted to the internet<br />
that she forgets to breathe</p>

<p>she asks<br />
how do i convert this<br />
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time cartridge<br />
into a bong&trade;<br />
 among other things</p>

<p>she walked into an abercrombie&amp;fitch, <br />
picked up some $80 shorts <br />
and started experiencing inexplicable thoughts <br />
of suicide, arson, defenestration etc</p>

<p>there she is now<br />
breathing heavily into a dorito bag<br />
and watching hulk hogan reality television program, <br />
etc<br />
her anxiety is relieved<br />
the secret is cablevision</p>

<p></p>

<p>
...<br />
i wish i was still in high school <br />
so that whenever anyone called me a nerd i could be like <br />
'well i'm fucking popular on twitter <br />
so go eat coal'</p>

<p>but now that i'm watching the world<br />
from behind a bookshelf<br />
i wonder<br />
what's a gigabyte taste like</p>

<p>i wish i was a hyperlink on an angelfire webpage <br />
circa 1995<br />
and not crouched in the grass<br />
with an ice cream cone </p>

<p>it's summer and <br />
this poem doesn't rhyme but<br />
who gives a fuck</p>

<p>//////////<br />
*eats organic cereal* ugh *goes to a poetry reading* ehg *goes <br />
home to williamsburg* sdkj *talks to my only friend cat* guh <br />
*glasses* henjhd <br />
//////////</p>

<p>i'm boycotting everything in this world except<br />
brooklyn summer ale<br />
and the flask decorated in<br />
lisa frank ocean life stickers<br />
strapped to my thigh</p>

<p>from now on<br />
when someone asks me where i work<br />
i'm going to<br />
literally pull out a knife and say<br />
'team rocket mother fucker'</p>

<p>p.s.</p>

<p>will they shoot me if i throw a pokeball at the white house?</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>i opened up a microsoft word document<br />
clippy krumped onto the screen--<br />
'fucking hipster,' he sneered</p>

<p>it's 11am and my only hope is this reeses mini cup<br />
it's fine i have a salary and benefits<br />
a macbook air and<br />
i ate a box of cheese crackers in two days flat<br />
it must be an omen that i will die alone<br />
but it's like<br />
whatever</p>

<p>like when you are zen<br />
but actually chewing the polish off your own nails</p>

<p>in any case, i think i'll<br />
trespass the cafe<br />
where everyone is beautiful and<br />
changing the world with a single<br />
earth shattering click<br />
because i want to <br />
be cool too</p>

<p>i wear crop tops to<br />
professional events and<br />
listen to rave music at Staples<br />
hi-chew for breakfast<br />
sega dreamcast catcher<br />
wake up and<br />
smell the <br />
neighbors smoking<br />
cloves</p>

<p>'this view is extraordinary'<br />
i sigh and<br />
stare deeply<br />
into the horizon of my <br />
macbook desktop,<br />
the sun slowly uploading<br />
into day</p></div></center>
